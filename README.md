### What I learned

Through the challenge I was able to put into practice some things that were introduced in Vue3 through the Composition API, such as `<script setup>`, composables and the store with Pinia. Having developed with Vue in its version 2 and then Vue in its version 3 but with the Options API, I obtained a slightly broader view of the Composition API. Now the next step is to participate in other challenges, putting into practice what I have learned and extending my knowledge with Setup.
